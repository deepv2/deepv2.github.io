## Hello! Welcome to my website!

My name is Deepan Venkatesh: computer fan at heart! I've loved tinkering with technology ever since a young age.

A little about myself: I've graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering. Currently, I am working towards an MCS degree in Computer Science also at the same university.
