## Hello! Welcome to my website!

My name is Deepan Venkatesh: computer fan at heart! I've loved tinkering with technology ever since a young age.

A little about myself: I've graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering. Currently, I am working towards an MCS degree in Computer Science also at the same university.

At my university, I was part of the LLVM research group as an undergraduate researcher. During my time, I helped work on a paper "[Scalable Validation of Binary Lifters](https://pldi20.sigplan.org/details/pldi-2020-papers/4/Scalable-Validation-of-Binary-Lifters)", which was accepted into PLDI 2020. I assisted in the optimization of the LLVM passes used in the matching engine, which massively improved results compared to using LLVM's standard O3 pass pipeline.

At the current time in Summer 2020, I am an Business Technology intern at Discover Financial Services. I am part of the Network Security Engineering team. I can tell you more about the internship after the summer is over!

I love to play video games and tinker around with electronics.
